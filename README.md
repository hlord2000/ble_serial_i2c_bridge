# BLE Serial -> I2C Bridge

This sample provides an encrypted I2C connection to an nRF54L15 acting as I2C peripheral. This I2C peripheral simultaneously acts as an authenticated and encrypted BLE peripheral that will only accept writes or send notifications to a properly authenticated BLE central.

Authentication and encryption uses AES-CTR with a randomized 16 byte nonce. Care should be taken to never repeat a nonce. Although using a random nonce provides reasonable security, a more robust option would be to use a monotonically increasing counter.

Note that the I2C peripheral and BLE peripheral functions of the nRF54L15 share a pre-shared key (PSK). This PSK would, ideally, be different between the I2C central and the BLE central. Also note that these examples operate without TF-M or use of secure key storage which **must** be implemented for proper device security.

## Hardware Connections
| Function          | Peripheral | Central |
|-------------------|------------|---------|
| SCL               | P1.13      | P0.27   |
| SDA               | P1.09      | P0.26   |
| INT               | P1.11      | P1.15   |
| Reference Voltage | VDDIO      | VIO_REF |

**It is critical that the VIO_REF of the I2C central is the same as the VDDIO of the nRF54L15-PDK**

**To enable pull-ups on the I2C central, connect the "DETECT" pin to ground**

**Also connect ground between both kits**

## I2C Central Use

To read from a register (where 0x06 is the RX register):
```
encrypt_send 0x06
```
A packet with an empty body is interpreted as a read command.
The I2C central will automatically read the RX register whenever the "INT" pin is high.

To write to a register (where 0x05 is the TX register):
```
encrypt_send 0x05 helloworld
```

---

## Desktop BLE App Setup
```
cd ble_app
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Authentication will proceed automatically with a supported device.
The app will be notified of any data transmission from the I2C central and can send data to the I2C central.

## Theory of operation
BLE central devices support a wide variety of authentication methods for connected devices. These include "Just Works" pairing that requires no input from the user through a keypad or display. Unfortunately, if a peripheral device has no means for input or output of data, it is impossible to authenticate a BLE connection without additional handling at the application layer.

To accomplish this, a pre-shared key (AES-128) is given to the BLE peripheral and BLE central. All communication across the BLE or I2C link will be encrypted with this key using [AES-CTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_(CTR)) with a 128-bit nonce.
The central device connects to the peripheral. On the peripheral, an "authentication timer" is started. If the central device does not send a proper authentication packet to the authentication characteristic, the peripheral automatically disconnects from the central.
After authentication the central subscribes to notifications from the peripheral and is able to send encrypted packets to the peripheral.

On the I2C side of the link, communications are similarly encrypted. The I2C peripheral uses a separate interrupt line to notify the I2C central of newly available data and automatically sends any data over BLE to the connected central as it becomes available.

The I2C peripheral implements a number of 16-byte wide registers. When a command is written from the I2C central, the register value's associated read or write function is called in "i2c_periphral/src/i2c_registers.c"
